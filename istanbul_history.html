                    <h2>Neolithic Era <i>First Millennium BC</i></h2>
                    <p>Archeological work indicates that humans have inhabited the
                    area known today as "İstanbul" since the seventh century BC.
                    The region was first named "Byzantion" in Greek by King Byzas
                    who led his Hellenic settlers from the Greek municipality of
                    Megara to the Asian or Anatolian side of the undiscovered
                    lands to the east.
                    <br><br>
                    In the sixth century, the Persians captured the city, but like
                    many military annexations, this did not last as Alexander the
                    Great retook the city back into Hellenic control following the
                    fourth century BC.

                    <p>Despite becoming part of the Roman Empire in 70 AD, the city
                    of Byzantion retained enough autonomy to be classified as a
                    "free-city". The city lost its local authority in 193 AD due
                    to Roman emperor Septimus Severus's army successfully sieging
                    Byzantion. As the mid-fourth century approached, the tables
                    turned when Emperor Constantine I declared Byzantion as capital
                    of the most advanced ancient power: The Roman Empire.</p>

                    <p>Konstantine would go on to not only make Christianity the official
                    religion of the Roman Empire, but also declared Constantinople as
                    the centre of Orthodox Christianity. Between the 4th and 6th centuries,
                    the population of Byzantion hovered around half a million. Under
                    the reign of Justinian I, in the 6th century, the Hagia Sophia was
                    erected to represent the architectural and cultural icon of Byzantine
                    and Eastern Orthodox civilisation.
                    <br><br> 
                    Whilst the walls of Constantinople fell to pieces on May 29th, 1453,
                    following the intense bombing ordered by Mehmet II, it became 
                    unquestionable that emporer Konstantine's vision for the city he so
                    heavily uplifted, would be replaced by an alternative route.</p>

                    <h2>A New Stronghold For The Ottomans <i>May 29th, 1453 - November 1st, 1922</i></h2>
                    <p>Granting them control over the Silk Road, Bosporus Strait, and
                    a strategic advantage for launching invasions into Europe, the
                    conquered metropolis instantly became the capital of the Ottoman
                    Empire.
                    <br><br>
                    The Sultan did not want his army to fully destroy the city as he
                    had the ambition of making it the centre of his empire.
                    <br><br>
                    Mehmed II was believed to be fluent in six languages including Greek.
                    Perhaps this can help explain why he allowed not only many of the
                    Greek inhabitants to remain, but also maintained some of their churches.
                    <br><br>
                    Inevitably, Constantinople became an Islamic megalopolis with new mosques
                    being constructed, and the Hagia Sophia falling into the category of a
                    mosque. These events marked the collapse of the 1000+ year reign of the
                    Byzantine Empire.

                    <h2>Every Empire Decays Overtime <i>17th Century - 1923</i></h2>
                        <p>It is estimated that at some point in the 1600s, the Ottomans 
                        began to see their economic and military supremacy diminish little
                        by little. Many factors including the renaissance and the industrial 
                        revolution, resulted in neighboring European countries outproducing
                        the Ottomans in terms of weaponry. European expansion of trade with
                        India and the newly discovered Americas is also said to have weakened
                        Ottoman economic performance. The Ottoman defeat at the siege of Vienna
                        in 1683, is regarded as a pivotal point in the continuining failure
                        of the Ottomans to retain their land in South Eastern European.
                        <br><br>
                        Joining the Central Powers in WW1 is widely seen as the geopolitical blunder 
                        that led to the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in 1922. The Allied Powers 
                        would go on to occupy Istanbul from 1918 until October 29th, 1923 when a 
                        high-ranking general named Mustafa Kemal successfully negotiated for the 
                        independence of the "Republic of Türkiye". Thus, Mustafa Kemal became the 
                        first president of the new republic and was awarded the title "Atatürk" 
                        meaning "Father of the Turks". The new capital was proclaimed as Ankara for
                        it was the centre of his resistance movement.</p>

                <h2>
                    A Secularist Republic Emerging From The Ashes <i>October 29th, 1923 - Present</i>
                </h2>
                <p>Atatürk's reforms transformed the country into a secular republic. The sultanate
                (political role of the Sultan) was abolished to be replaced by a president. Women
                were granted full universal suffrage in 1930. The alphabet was changed from Arabic
                letters to latin ones. The Hagia Sophia went from being a mosque to a museum in 
                1934. Atatürk required that the Islamic call to prayer (ezan) be done in Turkish 
                because he belived that if a person follows a religion, he should understand the 
                words being expressed. The previous two reforms would later be reversed.
                <br><br>
                Despite having its offical name change to "İstanbul" by 1930, the city was
                no longer the largest in an Islamic state. From then on, Türkiye has remained a 
                secular Muslim country rather than an Islamic one because there is no mention of
                Islam in the Turkish constitution.</p>
